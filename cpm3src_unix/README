Recent changes
==============

2025-01-22:
  An additional binary patch has been applied to the program loader,
to match the Digital Research CCP. Without this, it was possible for DR Logo
to fail to load with a "Cannot load Program" error. Also, the build process
has been updated so that the terminating $ on the "Cannot load Program"
message was not overwritten.

Differences from Digital Research CP/M 3
========================================

  All the CP/M 3 patches described in the document CPM3FIX.PAT have been
applied to the source code, including those to INITDIR.COM

  CP/M 3 is now fully Year 2000 compliant. This affects the programs 
DATE.COM, DIR.COM and SHOW.COM.

  Dates can be displayed in US, UK or Year-Month-Day format. This is set by 
SETDEF:

      SETDEF [US]
      SETDEF [UK]
      SETDEF [YMD]  respectively.
  
  The CCP has a further bug fix: A command sequence such as:

  C1
  :C2
  :C3

  will now not execute the command C3 if the command C1 failed.
