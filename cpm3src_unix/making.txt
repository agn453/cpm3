Compiling CP/M 3
================

  This repository is all that is necessary to build the CP/M 3
binary distribution under Linux/Unix/macOS.

  The Makefile has been written for GNU Make. You will need:

* The PL/M development system and the Intel PL/I-80 V1.4 compiler
  from the Unofficial CP/M Website
	<http://www.cpm.z80.de/binary.html>
* The ZXCC emulator (version 0.3 or later) installed.  Grab the
  updated version based on John Elliott's ZXCC v0.5.7 from
	<https://github.com/agn453/ZXCC>
* The thames emulator (version 0.1.0 or later) installed
	<http://www.seasip.info/Unix/Thames/>

  The PL/M system contains the PLM80 compiler, the ASM80 assembler, and the 
ISIS emulator. Unpack these to separate directories.

  The Intel PL/I-80 V1.4 contains CP/M binary PLI.COM and overlays PLI?.OVL
that you should extract to the ZXCC BINDIR80 directory (by default this is
/usr/local/lib/cpm/bin80) and the PL/I library PLILIB.IRL to the ZXCC LIBDIR80
(into /usr/local/lib/cpm/lib80).  These should have lowercase filenames so that
zxcc can find them.

  Edit the shell script run_thames to set the four directories:

ISIS_F0  source code directory
ISIS_F1  PLM80 compiler
ISIS_F2  ASM80 assembler
ISIS_F3  ISIS emulator and libraries

  'make all' will then set the build in motion. Since the build tools do not
return error codes, you will have to watch for error messages yourself,
and stop the build if you see one.

  When GENCOM is being run, you may see a "corrupt FCB" message. This is
caused by GENCOM closing a file it didn't open, and you may safely ignore it.

  The build date is stored in five files:

MCD80A.ASM
MCD80D.ASM
MCD80F.ASM
MAKEDATE.LIB
SHOW.PLM

and you should change all of these if you are making a new release.

Pre-built binaries are in the cpm-dist/ folder.
